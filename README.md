# pyRapidPassGen
pyRapidPassGen is a simple password generator that creates strong and secure passwords in just a few quick steps. Features include customizable length, quantity, and special character settings. The script uses ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation characters from the string module and the choice() function from the secrets module to randomly select characters from the chosen character sets for password generation. 

Users can configure their password preferences by answering a series of questions, after which the script generates and displays the specified number of passwords. Additionally, there is an option to restart the configuration process.
